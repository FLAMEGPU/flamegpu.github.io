    abstract: Driven by the availability of experimental data and ability to simulate
      a biological scale which is of immediate interest, the cellular scale is fast
      emerging as an ideal candidate for middle-out modelling. As with 'bottom-up'simulation
      approaches, cellular level simulations demand a high degree of computational
      power, which in large-scale simulations can only be achieved through parallel
      computing. The flexible large-scale agent modelling environment (FLAME) is a
      template driven framework for agent-based modelling (ABM) on parallel

    abstract: High performance computing is essential for simulating complex problems
      using agent-based modelling (ABM). Researchers are hindered by complexities
      of porting models on parallel platforms and time taken to run large simulations
      on a single machine. This paper presents FLAME framework, the only supercomputing
      framework which automatically produces parallelisable code to execute on different
      parallel hardware architectures. FLAME's inherent parallelism allows large number
      of agents to be simulated in less time

    abstract: We present an efficient implementation of a high performance parallel
      framework for Agent Based Modelling (ABM), exploiting the parallel architecture
      of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It provides a mapping between formal
      agent specifications, with C based scripting, and optimised NVIDIA Compute Unified
      Device Architecture (CUDA) code. The mapping of agent data structures and agent
      communication is described, and our work is evaluated through a number of simple
      interacting agent examples. In contrast with an alternative

    abstract: Publisher Summary This chapter describes a number of key techniques
      that are used to implement a flexible agent-based modeling (ABM) framework entirely
      on the GPU in CUDA. Performance rates, which is better than high-performance
      computing (HPC) clusters, can easily be achieved. Agent-based modeling is a
      technique for computational simulation of complex interacting systems through
      the specification of the behavior of a number of autonomous individuals acting
      simultaneously. The focus on individuals is considerably

    abstract: Agent Based Modelling (ABM) is an approach for modelling dynamic systems
      and studying complex and emergent behaviour. ABMs have been widely applied in
      diverse disciplines including biology, economics, and social sciences. The scalability
      of ABM simulations is typically limited due to the computationally expensive
      nature of simulating a large number of individuals. As such, large scale ABM
      simulations are excellent candidates to apply parallel computing approaches
      such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In this

    abstract: Agents within multi-agent simulation environments frequently compete
      for limited resources, requiring negotiation to resolve 'conflict'. The negotiation
      process for resolving conflict often relies on a transactional or serial processes
      that complicates implementation within a parallel simulation framework. This
      paper demonstrates how transactional events to resolve competition can be implemented
      within a parallel simulation framework (FLAME GPU) as a series of iterative
      parallel agent functions. A sugarscape model where agents compete for
