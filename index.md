FLAME GPU is a GPU accelerated simulator for domain independent complex systems simulations. 
Version 2 brings a complete re-write of the existing library offering greater flexibility, an improved interface for agent scripting and better research software engineering.

FLAME GPU provides a mapping between a formal agent specifications with C based scripting and optimised CUDA code. 
This includes a number of key ABM building blocks such as multiple agent types, agent communication and birth and death allocation. 


The advantages of our contribution are three fold. 
+ Firstly Agent Based (AB) modellers are able to focus on specifying agent behaviour and run simulations without explicit understanding of CUDA programming or GPU optimisation strategies. 
+ Secondly simulation performance is significantly increased in comparison with desktop CPU alternatives. 
This allows simulation of far larger model sizes with high performance at a fraction of the cost of grid based alternatives. 
+ Finally massive agent populations can be visualised in real time as agent data is already located on the GPU hardware.
