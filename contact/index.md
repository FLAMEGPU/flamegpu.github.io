FLAME GPU 2 builds upon a decade on research experience with FLAME GPU 1 and has been developed as part of a EPSRC RSE fellowship belonging to [Dr Paul Richmond](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/). 
It has also had significant investment from the FLAME GPU team who are developing it as part of the PRIMAGE and STriTuVaD projects.
